This document gives an explanation to the State Diagram and the various state's. In the diagram there is an overarching Powered On state 
which indicates that the states inside can only be accessed when the device is powered on. If the user presses the power button when the AED is on 
the system transitions back to the PoweredOffState no matter what state the AED is currently in. Also if at any point while the AED is powered on and
the electrodes are uninstalled the system transistions to ElectrodesNotInstalled state where it waits for the them to be reinstalled before continuing. 

Description of all the states:

1. The AED starts off in the PoweredOffState

2. If the power button is pressed, the AED transitions to the PoweredOn state.

3. the AED then transistions to the SelfTestState.

4. If the battery is sufficient and the electrodes are installed, it transitions to the CheckResponsivenessState.

5. The AED then transistions to the CallForHelpState.

6. The AED then transitions to the AttachDefibrillatorPadsState.

7. Once the electrode pads are attached, it transitions to the AnalyzingState.

8. The AED will then loop between the AnalyzingState and the PerformCPRState. 
If the battery is insufficient to adminstrer a shock the AED transitions to the LowBatteryState.
